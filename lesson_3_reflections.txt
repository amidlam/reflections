When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    collaboration with others, using different work stations, traveling, 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    to have user control of changes updated to the repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks allow the user to copy another users repository to their own without 
    changing the original, clones is a copy of the users repository and its 
    history may be local or remote, branches are a collection of commits used 
    when an idea, version or a bug is pursued differently from master branch 
    leaving master intact  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    allow you to see what state the remote is in, if changes are made to the 
    remote you can pull their differences

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    use file sharing with DropBox or Google Drive, logging into the shared folder
    provides easy access to files, it is difficult to maintain version control
    when edited files overwrite existing files. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
